        <p className='p__opensans'>The story of Fortress Restaurant is one of passion, partnership, and a shared vision for excellence. It began with Mr. Maphanga, a visionary whose dedication to fine dining and culinary artistry laid the foundation for what would become a landmark in the gastronomic world. Alongside him was his wife, Mrs. Maphanga, whose love for hospitality and attention to detail added warmth and charm to the heart of Fortress. 
        <div />
        Together, they dreamed of creating a place where strength, elegance, and exquisite cuisine could unite in perfect harmony. With a team of world-class chefs and culinary innovators, Mr. and Mrs. Maphanga set out to build Fortress Restaurantâ€”a sanctuary where every dish tells a story of craftsmanship and heritage.
